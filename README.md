## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```

Run the package install command:
```bash
php artisan teamwork:install
```
This will publish and register the TeamworkServiceProvider and will also generate a config file `config/teamwork.php`.

If you edit the config file and want to restore the defaults run:
```bash
php artisan teamwork:publish
```

## Usage

``` php
// Comming soon...
```

### Testing
